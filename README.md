# Kalman Filter in Autonomous Car Following

This code simulates a simple model of autonomous car following where one of the following cars uses a Kalam filter 
while the other does not. The positions of the cars, separations, and the accelarations are plotted. 
The process noise and measurement noise are parameters that can be varied interactively.
